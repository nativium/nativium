# Requirements

The general minimum requirements that you need is:

1. Python 3 ([https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org))
2. PIP ([https://pip.pypa.io](https://pip.pypa.io))
3. CMake 3.20.0 ([https://cmake.org](https://cmake.org))
4. Conan 1.48.0 ([https://conan.io](https://conan.io))
5. Java 11 (JDK) ([https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads))

These are the tools that Nativium need to work. Check on terminal if you have every tool in your path typing their names (python, pip, cmake, conan and java).

And for each platform you need have others small requirements.

Obs: Generally Python 3 already come with PIP installed. Check it with command `python3 -m pip --version`.

4. Optional system headers (only if you have problems on old macOS versions). Run on terminal: `open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg`

Obs: On step #4 the path can change for each macOS version (10.14 is mojave) and this is required because old softwares search on old places for this headers, like old openssl versions.
