# About

Write a **single code** in C++ and compile for **any platform**.

Supported platforms:

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows
- Android
- iOS
- tvOS
- watchOS
- macCatalyst
- Web Assembly (WASM)

This **template** project generates **libraries** and **executables** that share the same C++ code between them.

The generated binary can be used in a **new project** or an **existing project**.

You can also write **platform-specific** code that talks to C++ code, and you can write C++ code that talks directly to **platform code**. An example would be a C++ code that talks to the **mobile platform** (Java and Objective-C) to know the battery level, or a code used on the mobile platform that uses C++ libraries to access the database and make HTTP requests.

## Why i need use it?

Some projects require a single business logic code for multiple platforms instead of write a code for each platform.

Native code in C++ is very secure and performs better than other languages.

This project is the best option for anyone who wants to start a native project for all supported platforms and doesn't want to worry about how to get started, as it is ready for that purpose and ready to be used in production.

## I need make my project in C++?

No, you can "plug" the binary generated by Nativium into a new or existing application (mobile, desktop or web).

The final binary can have only the part that you want share between all platforms.

Usually the user interface is done with the platform's own tools, for example, Swift and SwiftUI or Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, but business rules or code that needs more secure and heavy processing is done with C++.

## It is free?

Yes, you can use it for free, for any purpose, whether personal or commercial.

Feel free to collaborate by improving the project or providing feedback.
